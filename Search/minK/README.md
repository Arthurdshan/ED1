## minK

Implementations of:

- Heap sort
- Quick sort
- Selection sort

with the goal of finding the K-th smallest element on a random vector.

To run this, just type "make" on your terminal inside "Search" folder.

## WARNING: ##

The sorting algorithms are NOT fully implemented here! I just used the strictly necessary to make the minK algorithms work!
